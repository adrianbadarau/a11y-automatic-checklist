# Agent Rules

The following rules must be strictly adhered to by any Antigravity agent operating in this repository:

1. **No Commits**: Do not ever commit anything. Never run `git commit`.
2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Always use a TDD approach when developing. Write failing tests first, ensure they fail, then write the minimal code required to pass the tests, and finally refactor if necessary.
